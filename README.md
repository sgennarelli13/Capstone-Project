# Capstone Project
A hands-on project at Flatiron School, resulting in a detailed professional report that demonstrates my proficiency in addressing real-world security challenges.

## Abstract
The Cybersecurity Capstone combines all the skills acquired over the course and provides an opportunity to demonstrate teamwork and competency. Completing the capstone will require using the technical and communication skills learned throughout the program, as well as critical thinking.

## Scenario
A large manufacturing company named ACME was recently hacked. During the investigation, the previous security team was terminated, and a new Security Operations Center (SOC) was formed. To fill the open security engineering and analyst positions, the new Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has approved immediate staffing with qualified contractors. 

As one of the new contractors, the CISO has given me several directives:

1) Vulnerability Scan Writeup - Conduct a scan of Acme's internal and DMZ networks. Submit a report detailing each vulnerability found in order of threat level.

2) Create Internal Honeypot - Recommend a honeypot solution that can be used to detect potential attacks. Also, please include in the plan what tools our analysts would need, how much this project will cost, and if we can utilize any tools already in place to see any activities detected or deflected.

3) Internal Ticket System - Research possible ticketing systems, including system options, resources needed (whether new or existing), the budget required, and the architecture needed for implementing each ticketing system. Submit a report with a recommendation on installing a ticketing system to allow for a more robust tracking of outstanding issues.

4) Log File Review - Review the log files and create a report of any activity you deem suspicious. Be specific and, if possible, provide examples from the log data.

5) Gather Network Assets - Conduct an asset search and report the findings. Also create a new topology map to reflect the current network.

6) Final Security Plan with Timeline - Put together a security roadmap report for the organization that includes what we can either fix or mitigate in the next 90 days, 6 months, and 12-18 months. This roadmap will help us reduce risk across the organization, plan our budget appropriately, and helps us keep our cyber insurance premiums lower because we can show a more mature security posture to insurance brokers.
